<h1>What is this Website?</h1>
<p class="bodyP">A horrible but hopefully entertaining attempt at trying to stay on topic while explaining Guilty Gear.</p>

<iframe id="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gp4-n_u-qM0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p class="bodyP">This music video was made to celebrate the first anniversary of <em>Guilty Gear: -Strive-</em>, the latest entry in the franchise. The visuals depict certain important scenes in the incredibly long
and complex story of the series while the music is the theme of Sol Badguy, the protagonist, form the latest entry. In Guilty Gear: -Strive-, each playable character has their own dedicated vocal theme that provides insight
into their life, experiences, and views. While I do personally prefer the vocal tracks in Guilty Gear Xrd over those in Strive, it is a very effective approach to ensure that players will have some understanding
of the characters and their story even when just getting into the series. </p>
	
	
<h1>An Apology...</h1>
<p class="bodyP">It is with great remorse that I inform you that I lied when responding to the last question. This is not an attempt to explain Guilty Gear, this is a very stupid way for me to fulfill 
requirements. Be warned that the rest of this site depicts my stupidity in it's entirety.</p>
