<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilty_Gear">Guilty Gear (Japanese: ギルティギア, Hepburn: Giruti Gia) is a series of fighting games by Arc System Works, created and designed by artist Daisuke Ishiwatari. 
The first game was published in 1998, and has spawned several sequels. It has also adapted to other media such as manga and drama CD. Guilty Gear has generally received praise from video game reviewers for its 
highly technical gameplay, graphics, soundtrack, and for its characters. Another fighting game franchise by Arc System Works, BlazBlue, is considered a spiritual successor of the series.
