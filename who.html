<h2>Note:</h2>
<p>First, a bit of clarification regarding the protagonist, <strong>Sol Badguy.</strong> Contrary to what you might believe, he is actually a <em>good</em> guy. He even bought me a sandwich once.
 Henceforth, he shall be referred to as <u><strong>"Sol Badguy (Good)".	</strong></u></p>

<h1>Who is Guilty Gear?</h1>

<p class="bodyP">Sol Badguy (Good), is the <strong>Guilty Gear</strong>. He is, in fact, a <strong>Gear</strong> who is <strong>Guilty</strong>. </p>

</figure>
<p class="bodyP">Now you might find yourself wondering: <em>"What exactly IS a Gear?"</em> Me too.</p>

<p class="bodyP">Many unfortunate souls have made the mistake of confusing Sol Badguy (Good) with Saul Goodman from the TV series <em>Better Call Saul</em> (Who is not a very nice person and will henceforth be referred to as Saul Goodman (Bad)). 
This is an unforgivable sin and I pray that whatever gods may be shall smite those who have committed such a misdeed. Those with the sharpest of minds may have noticed that Saul 
Goodman (Bad) is a lawyer, and to assume that Mr. Badguy (Good) could possess even a fraction
of the brainpower required in such a profession is an insult to all Sol (Good) mains across the world.</p>

<h2>Note:</h2>
<p>It has come to my attention that despite the lack of any display of intelligence, saying that Sol (Good) players cannot be lawyers is both untrue and "not very kind". To avoid any similar circumstances, 
Sol (Good) players shall henceforth be referred to as "Talented and Intelligent Players" </p>
<p> - Sincerely, a Talented and Intelligent Player</p>

<h1>How does Sol Badguy (Good) Play?</h1>

<p class="bodyP"> Talented and Intelligent Players tend to incorporate a variety of effective strategies when playing as Sol Badguy (Good). These strategies include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>Constantly using Volcanic Viper on wakeup with little regard to how their opponent is playing around it.</li>
	<li>Gunflame</li>
	<li>Pressing buttons like Far Slash repeatedly in neutral situations</li>
	<li>Gunflame</li>
	<li>Playing as aggressively as possible</li>
	<li>Gunflame</li>
</ul>
<p class="bodyP"> Talented and Intelligent Players often use all of these techniques together as part of their overall strategy. Many other players are often annoyed by the gameplay of Talented and Intelligent 
Players, but the truth is that Sol Badguy (Good)'s gameplan is one that benefits from unpredictability. The seemingly random and impatient gameplay of Talented and Intelligent players is in reality a simple yet
effective attempt to force the opponent to become so angry at the game they mess up on their own and lose. Thus, Talented and Intelligent players manage to win just enough to encourage them to stick with their
style of play.</p>
